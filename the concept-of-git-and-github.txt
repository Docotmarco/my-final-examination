Git is a distributed Version Control sytem that enables 
you to save copies  of files frequently with the ability
 to merge work done by more than 1 person and also stores 
 each change to a file by saving the entire file.

github is a remote source that you normally push and 
pull those committed changes to if you have (or are added to)
 such a repository and  you can make changes as you 
 wish by pulling and pushing them to a local machine.
